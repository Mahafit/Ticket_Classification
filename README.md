# Ticket_Classification

## Overview

The Ticket_Classification project is a Streamlit web application designed to classify emails as either "Request" or "Incident" using a language model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Key features include data loading, text processing, and batch classification, with a user-friendly interface for both single and batch inputs. The project is suitable for IT support teams and customer service departments, providing an efficient way to automate and streamline ticket classification, thereby improving response times and operational efficiency. The setup is streamlined with files like `requirements.txt`, `Procfile`, and `setup.sh` to ensure a smooth deployment process.

## Features

### Web Application

- The web application is implemented using Streamlit, providing a user interface for classifying emails.
- It supports both single and batch email classification using a language model and RAG.
- The application is configured to run in headless mode, with CORS disabled and a specified port, as set up in `setup.sh`.
- The `Procfile` specifies the command to run the web application using Streamlit.


### Streamlit Integration

- The `app.py` file implements a Streamlit web application for classifying emails.
- The `Procfile` specifies the command to run the web application using Streamlit.
- The `setup.sh` script configures Streamlit to run in headless mode, disable CORS, and use a specified port.


### Email Classification

- The project uses a language model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for classifying emails.
- The web application, implemented in `app.py`, provides a user interface for classifying emails as either "Request" or "Incident".
- Functions for data loading, text processing, and batch classification are included in the application.


### RAG Implementation

- - No specific information found regarding RAG Implementation in the provided project context.


### Headless Mode

- The `setup.sh` script configures Streamlit to run in headless mode.
- Headless mode is used to run the Streamlit application without a graphical user interface, typically for server environments or automated processes.


### CORS Management

- - The `setup.sh` script disables CORS, which is necessary for allowing the web application to handle cross-origin requests.
- No specific information found regarding further details on CORS management within the project.


### Dependency Management

- The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project, ensuring a consistent environment for development and deployment.
- The `setup.sh` script may include steps to install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` and configure the environment.

  | File Name | Summary |
  |-----------|---------|
  | `Procfile` | The `Procfile` specifies the command to run the web application, in this case, using Streamlit to execute `app.py`. |
  | `app.py` | This file implements a Streamlit web application for classifying emails as either "Request" or "Incident" using a language model and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It includes functions for data loading, text processing, and batch classification, and provides a user interface for single and batch email classification. |
  | `requirements.txt` | This `requirements.txt` file lists the Python packages and their versions required for the project, ensuring a consistent environment for development and deployment. |
  | `setup.sh` | This script sets up a Streamlit configuration file to run in headless mode, disable CORS, and use a specified port. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Package Manager**: Pip
- **Other Requirements**: None explicitly mentioned.

### Installation
1. **Clone repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mahafit/Ticket_Classification
   ```

2. **Navigate to directory**:
   ```sh
   cd Ticket_Classification
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you prefer to use the setup script, you can run:
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```

#### Testing
- Information running tests is not readily available. Please consult the project's documentation or look for a dedicated testing guide.

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```sh
python app.py
```

Alternatively, if you are using the `Procfile` to manage the application, you can run:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

For more details, refer to the project's README or documentation. Look for `app.py`, `main.py`, or `package.json` scripts if the primary run command is not evident.

## Roadmap

No explicit roadmap has been provided for the **Ticket_Classification** project. If you have specific features or improvements in mind, feel free to check the issues section of the repository or contact the maintainers directly.

### Speculative Future Enhancements

Given the nature of the project, here are some potential areas for future development:

1. **Model Improvement**:
   - Experiment with different machine learning models to improve classification accuracy.
   - Implement ensemble methods to combine multiple models for better performance.

2. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Expand the dataset with more diverse and representative tickets to enhance model robustness.
   - Use data augmentation techniques to generate synthetic data for training.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Develop a web-based user interface to allow users to input tickets and receive classification results in real-time.
   - Integrate the model into an existing ticket management system.

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize the model for faster inference times.
   - Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency for frequently classified tickets.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Containerize the application using Docker for easier deployment.
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation for setup, usage, and contribution.
   - Provide examples and tutorials for users to understand how to use the project effectively.

7. **Community Engagement**:
   - Encourage community contributions by setting up a clear contribution guide.
   - Host regular meetups or webinars to discuss project updates and gather feedback.
